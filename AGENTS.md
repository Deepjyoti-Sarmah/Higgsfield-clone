# AGENTS.md: read this first (every agent, every model, every tool)

This is a rebuild of higgsfield.ai (AI image/video generation) in a 24h window.
The repo is the only memory we have. Chat history doesn't carry over between runs.

## Read order
1. `docs/STATUS.md`: what works, what's broken, what hasn't started
2. `docs/PLAN.md`: milestones, task board, role assignments
3. Your task packet: `docs/tasks/T-NNN-k/brief.md` (if you were given one)
4. The spec + design it links to: `docs/specs/NNN-slug/`
5. `docs/STANDARDS.md`: code rules, which are enforced
6. `docs/DECISIONS.md` and `docs/architecture/architecture.md`: before changing anything structural
7. `docs/BUILD-PLAN.md`: the full approved plan (frozen; for context, not for status)

## Truth hierarchy (when sources disagree, the higher one wins)
running code + tests > `packages/contracts/openapi.json` > `design.md` > `spec.md` > `docs/PLAN.md` > chat

If you find a disagreement, fix the lower source or report it. Never silently follow the lower one.

## Definition of done (all of these, in one commit)
- [ ] The verify command from the task passed, with output pasted in `report.md`
- [ ] `scripts/check-standards` passes
- [ ] The task checkbox is ticked in `tasks.md`; the row is updated in `docs/PLAN.md`
- [ ] `docs/STATUS.md` updated (the line cites a file path + verify command)
- [ ] `docs/WORKLOG.md` has an appended line
- [ ] `.agent-logs/` is included in the commit
- [ ] The commit message is plain: **no `Co-Authored-By` or other attribution trailers**

## Hard rules
- Only touch the files your brief allows. If you need another file, stop and say so in `report.md`.
- Don't change the API contract (routes, schemas) unless the task says so.
- Never commit secrets. Config comes from env vars, with names listed in `.env.example`.
- Never run paid generation (OpenRouter) in tests. Use `GENERATION_BACKEND=mock`.
- Don't mark your own work reviewed. A different model reviews it.
- Report honestly: failing tests, skipped steps and guesses all go in `report.md`.

## Roles (any model can fill any role; current assignments are in `docs/PLAN.md`)
| Role | Needs | Does |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator | strongest reasoning, long context | specs, design, contracts, writes briefs, merges, the risky core (ledger, claim/lease, SSE, Modal adapter) |
| Implementer | solid coding | exactly one task packet |
| Reviewer | strong reasoning, different model from the implementer | diff vs acceptance criteria + STANDARDS |
| Scout | cheap, fast | cataloguing screenshots, grep, lint, doc sync |

**The task packet is the whole interface:**
- The orchestrator writes `docs/tasks/T-NNN-k/brief.md` (template: `docs/templates/delegation-brief.md`).
- The agent writes `report.md` next to it (template: `docs/templates/report.md`).
- The orchestrator re-runs the verify command itself; reported results aren't trusted.

## Capturing prompts and responses (required by the assignment)
- **Claude Code:** automatic through `.claude/settings.json` hooks (prompt, response, subagent delegation and output).
- **Any other CLI or model:** run it ONLY through `scripts/agent-run <tool> <task-id>`.
- **Tools that can't be wrapped** (e.g. IDE chat): export the transcript into `.agent-logs/` before committing.

## Playbooks (procedures that work in any tool)
| Playbook | Use when |
|---|---|
| `docs/playbooks/research-flow.md` | turning product screenshots into flow notes |
| `docs/playbooks/spec-new.md` | starting a feature |
| `docs/playbooks/task-run.md` | implementing one task packet |
| `docs/playbooks/verify-slice.md` | checking a feature on the live URL |
| `docs/playbooks/handoff.md` | ending any session |
